# MNIST_Explore_simple_CNN
Exploring the MNIST hand-written digit classification problem using a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Individual codes have built-in README sections within. Codes can be executed on the command line or within a Python IDE (Spyder for example: change working directory first)

1. Training: Run MNIST_train.py [RUN THIS FIRST]
2. Testing and Evaluation: Run MNIST_test.py (requires a trained model and test data to run: test data is provided in the "MNIST" folder and a trained model is provided in the "MNIST_weights" folder)

3. Model Architecture and Design: model.py (for designing the CNN architecture and parameters and import purposes in the tarining and testing codes only)

4. Things that can be done further on MNIST for similar datsets and problems:
	1. Visualizing the learnt features and kernels
	2. Run model explanation analysis (Saliency Maps, Grad-CAM and others and their variants)
	3. Run PCA/tSNE/UMAP analysis for further exploration
	4. Try other architectures - Residual Networks for instance, to achieve near perfect accuracy if needed.
	5. Use GANs to generate synthetic data to potentially develop an active learning platform
